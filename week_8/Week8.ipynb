    "### 1. What’s the point of Figure 7?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7 is a **design space analysis of 58 narrative visualizations**. It shows which narrative design features each visualization does (and does not) use, highlighting notable patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clusters of ordering strategies** (e.g., slide shows vs. comic strips vs. partitioned posters) that correspond to distinct genres of visual narration.  \n",
    "- The **consistency of interaction design choices** (e.g., hover highlighting, details-on-demand).  \n",
    "- The **under-utilization of methods that engage the user more fully** (e.g., tacit tutorials).  \n",
    "- The **under-utilization of certain storytelling and messaging techniques** (e.g., repetition of key points, final summaries) across many interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In other words, Figure 7 helps researchers see, at a glance, **which design patterns are commonly used, which are rarely used**, and how different genres of data stories tend to cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. From Figure 7, what are the most common design choices within each category?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7 breaks **“Visual Narrative Tactics”** into:\n",
    "- Visual structuring  \n",
    "- Highlighting  \n",
    "- Transition guidance  \n",
    "\n",
    "And **“Narrative Structure Tactics”** into:\n",
    "- Ordering  \n",
    "- Interactivity  \n",
    "- Messaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the most frequent or dominant design choices mentioned in the paper for each of these six subcategories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Visual Narrative Tactics\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Visual Structuring**\n",
    "- **Consistent visual platform** (e.g., same coordinate system, color palette, layout) is especially common.\n",
    "- **Establishing shot** (initial overview) also appears frequently, though less than consistent platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Highlighting**\n",
    "- **Hover highlighting** is particularly widespread in interactive examples (hovering the cursor over elements reveals color changes or pop-up details).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Transition Guidance**\n",
    "- **Animated transitions** (e.g., smoothly morphing charts or maps between views) appear in many online data stories.\n",
    "- **Advanced film-style methods** (e.g., full continuity editing, camera motion) are under-used compared to simpler animation cues.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Narrative Structure Tactics\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Ordering**\n",
    "- **Linear ordering** is the most common, especially in slideshow or step-by-step annotated charts.\n",
    "- A smaller fraction uses **user-directed paths** or **random access**, but most examples follow a structured, linear path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Interactivity**\n",
    "- **Hover details-on-demand**, **navigation buttons**, and **explicit instructions** (e.g., \"Click here\", \"Hover over the bar to see more\") appear consistently.\n",
    "- Techniques like **tacit tutorials** or **stimulating default views** are **under-utilized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Messaging**\n",
    "- **Captions/headlines** and **short annotations** are extremely common.\n",
    "- More robust messaging elements like **repetition of key points**, **final summaries**, or **multi-messaging (text + audio + visuals)** are fairly rare, except in slideshows and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Favorite and least favorite genres of narrative visualization (Figure 8, Section 4.3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Favorite genre:**  \n",
    "> **Slide Shows** — This format strikes a nice balance between **author-driven storytelling** and **user exploration**.  \n",
    "Each “slide” can incorporate interaction (e.g., filtering or hovering), while the author still guides the narrative in digestible segments. It’s great for complex datasets: the audience can pause, revisit slides, and build understanding gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Least favorite genre:**  \n",
    "> **Partitioned Poster** — This genre arranges multiple charts on one screen with minimal guidance on reading order.  \n",
    "While good for quick comparisons, it often lacks storytelling clarity. Viewers may not know where to start or how to proceed, making the story feel disjointed and less engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ultimately, genre choice depends on the **data, audience, and storytelling goals**.  \n",
    "Each genre has merits and tradeoffs, but **Slide Shows** and **Annotated Charts** often combine structured storytelling with interactivity to keep users engaged."

    "\n",
    "> *Exercise*: Create a short data-story based on the work we've done in class so far. (This exercise is a kind of \"micro version\" of what we'll be doing in the final project). Follow the directions in the bulleted list below when you create your data-story.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Find your own story to tell in the work on analyzing the SF Crime Data that we've done so far** (Week 1 - Week 6). The idea is to choose an insight about crime in SF (perhaps how something changed over the years) and communicate that insight to a general audience reader. (Don't use the prostitution data since we covered that last week. )\n",
    "* The web-page should be hosted on your GitHub Pages site (Week 7).\n",
    "* The format must be the classic *Magazine Genre* presented on a single web-page (see the Segel \\& Heer paper for details).\n",
    "* The story should have a brief introduction to the dataset so new readers from outside the class can understand what's going on.\n",
    "* Your story should include three visualizations. Not more than three, not less than three (but multi-panel figures are OK). The figures should be one of each of the following types\n",
    "  - One time-series / bar chart (it's OK to use the \"fancy\" plot-typs like calendar plots or polar bar-charts if you think those help you tell the story.\n",
    "  - One map\n",
    "  - One interactive visualization in Bokeh (Week 6)\n",
    "* **At a minimum, the Bokeh visualization should contain different data than the exercise we did for Week 6** (it's a plus if it's a new type of viz altogether). \n",
    "* The two other visualization may be repetitions of figures created during the previous lectures, or they may be new.\n",
    "* Make the figures nice. Specifically:\n",
    "  - Aim to make the figures visually consistent (color, fonts, etc).\n",
    "  - Follow the recommendations from my video on nice figures.\n",
    "* In terms of the amount of text, I envision something like 500-1500 words (including figure captions). <font color=\"gray\">Please write in your own words. Some LLMs have a tendency to write a lot of text and not be so precise. So if the writing is all elegantly written but empty prose, we will be critical. It is OK, however, to have the LLM help you get the grammer, etc. right.</font>\n",
    "* It is a plus if you can back up some of your findings with external sources, such as news stories from the area, looking up which building is located at some set of `lat,lon` coordinates, or similar. (So when you see something happening at some time/place in the data, see if you can understand it more deeply by investigating outside the dataset.) Use real references at the end of the text to organize your links to the outside world.\n",
